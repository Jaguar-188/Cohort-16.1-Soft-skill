             A browser is a one that renders the web page from the remote server as per the request of end user. We generally write the code by using the syntax which can be understandable by us but the computer knows the binay language or you can say it accepts the data in terms of bytes. The intermidiate software converts the human understandble data into machine understandable data. So, that machine can process the request. The bytes of data is first converted into characters and then they are converted into tokens.
